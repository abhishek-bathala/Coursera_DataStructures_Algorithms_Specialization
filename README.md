## Notable Problems & Solutions
####  Bubble Detection (de Bruijn Graphs)
> Given error-prone reads, output whether there is a bubble (signifying multiple possible final genomes, and therefore, an error) by constructing a de Bruijn graph.

#### Assigning Airline Crews to Flights (Bipartite Graphs)
> Given a number of flights and a list of crews which can work on certain flights, maximize the number of assigned crews using network flows.

####  Find All Occurrences of Pattern in String (Knuth-Morris-Pratt)
> Given a string and a pattern, output all occurrences of the pattern in almost linear time using the KMP algorithm.

####  Find a Circulation in a Network (Network Flows)
> Given nodes of a network with minimum and maximum flow, determine whether flow can be assigned such that each edge does not exceed its capacity and each vertex has the same inflow and outflow.

####   Building Roads to Connect Cities (Spanning Trees)
> Given the coordinates of cities, output the minimum total length of paths such that there is a path between any 2 cities.
[Solution File](https://github.com/abhishek-bathala/Coursera_DataStructures_Algorithms_Specialization/blob/main/3_algorithms_on_graphs/week5_spanning_trees/1_connecting_points/connecting_points.cpp)
####  Hashing with Chains (Hash Tables)
> Given a hash function and number of buckets, take inputs to add, delete, or output a string into the hash table.
